        1) Java Class Loader makes the classes ready to use
        2) When the classes make ready, class members are loaded according to some order
          main method is the first to be loaded normally
        3) Sometimes we need something to be loaded before main method, for this scenario we use "static block".
          The codes inside the "static block" is executed before everything in the class, even before main method.
        4) Rule: "static" structures can work just with static class members
          Do not put non-static class members into static method, it will give error
        5) "static block" can be used just with "static" variables, because of the rule in 4th step
        6) "static block" is used to initialize(assigning first value) "static variables"

        Note: When we create a variable inside the main method, we do not use "static" keyword,
              because Java knows everything inside the main is "static"
